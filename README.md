 # DELAYED OIL TRANSFER PROJECT
**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
 **Objective** 
This project investigates the root causes of delays in the oil transfer
process and proposes a strategic solution plan. Through data analysis of operational workflows, resource
allocation, and process efficiency, this project seeks to identify trends and key areas for improvement.

**Scope**
 The analysis covers:
* Current transfer and handling protocols
* Staffing and equipment utilization patterns
*  Service delay patterns and external influencing factors
*   Operational bottlenecks and improvement opportunities
  
**Methodology**
 * Data Collection: Gathering logs, staffing data, equipment status, and service records.
 *  Analysis: Identifying delay trends and correlating them with operational factors.
 *  Root Cause Analysis: Identifying the primary contributors to the delay.
 *  Solution Proposal: Recommending solutions, such as process optimization and resource allocation.

  **Data Source**
   Data set provided by the client as a CSV file, which was downloaded and processed for
analysis.

**Tools**
1. Microsoft Excel: Utilized for preliminary data correction and initial review of the dataset.
